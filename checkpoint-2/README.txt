This is the README file for Checkpoint 2 of the database project.

Keming (he.1537) takes full responsibility for the Checkpoint 2
submission version of this Java front-end prototype.
There are plans to include more members in future versions.

* To run the program, 
	import into Java eclipse IDE and run MainApplication.java.

* To insert a new record into a relation, 
	follow the main menu prompt.
* To search for an existing record in a particular relation, 
	follow the main menu prompt.
* To update or delete an existing record in a particular relation,
	first follow the main menu prompt to search up such record;
	then follow further prompts to update or delete such record.
	
* The prototype implements 3 relations, 
	and populates each with 3 tuples.
	Please note that all changes to the data
	will reset once the program terminates.
